## OG Network Tools
A modern network toolbox built to feel like original android apps **without jank**. Downloads and opens **instantly**, seriously it's well **under 200KB!**
Why? - Because today's apps tend to feel slow and janky on anything but the latest hardware, no more.

**Device support** - All devices running **Android 3.0** and above are supported!

**How is is possible?** - The small size and **extreme compatibility** are possible thanks to our **no dependency** policy. This app literally has empty depecndecies block:

**Does it look good?** - The app uses the original andorid [**Holo**](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2012/01/holo-everywhere.html) theme, so it's perfect if you miss **good old days**, 
but we've also given it a **modern twist** with custom implementations of UI components like floating action button for example. If you don't believe just look at screenshots below.

## Contributing

Currently the thing that is needed the most is **testing**, especially on older devices **<=Android 4.3**. I unfortunately have an M1 Mac and am therefore unable to run these older emulators.
It would also be very nice if someone would take the time to extract user-facing text into **string resources** to make it **translatable**. I **don't** want to use @dimmen, it just complicates things.
Any other contributions are also welcome. There are **no specific guidelines** since this is a very small project; the only requirement is that you **care** about your **code** and
**others** who will **maintain** it. Using depracated APIs isn't as big of a problem here as it's in other projects since we need to maintain compatibility with very old devices
and avoid using any dependencies, but if you can **avoid using depracated APIs without adding an additional dependency**, you should do it. Also, please **don't suppress lints** that **can be
corrected** (not using string resources...), you **can**, however, suppress lints we cannot correct, at lest not without a library (using TabHost, it's deprecated but
to not use it we would need to add a dependency) or that are **not needed** (putting an IP address into string resources...). I'm also **open for any refactoring**.
